# Vue Learning Project
Welcome to my Vue.js learning project! This web application is a result of my exploration and experimentation with Vue.js. It serves as a space where I not only share my creative ideas but also document my journey of mastering this powerful JavaScript framework.

## Project Overview
This project is a simple platform where users can register, create, edit posts, and explore content created by other authors. Additionally, users can like posts, organize articles using tags, and access their own collection of articles in the "My Articles" section.

## Technologies Used

**Vue.js:** The project is built using the Vue.js framework, harnessing its simplicity and reactivity for creating dynamic user interfaces.

**Vuex:** Vuex, the state management pattern for Vue.js, is employed to manage and share state between components.

**Vue-router:** Vue-router facilitates seamless navigation within the application, creating a smooth and dynamic user experience.

## Running the Application
1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PavelVoitov/crypto-tracker.git
```
2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```
3. **Start the local server:**

```bash
npm run serve

Open the application in your browser.


Explore the application, create posts, and witness the Vue.js magic in action!

### Learning Vue.js
This project is not only a showcase of creative ideas but also a record of my learning process with Vue.js. Each component, directive, and feature was implemented as part of my learning journey. Feel free to dive into the source code to see how Vue.js concepts were applied.

### Future Enhancements
* Implement real data fetching to demonstrate Vue.js in a more realistic scenario.
* Enhance styling and user interface for a more polished look.
* Integrate additional Vue.js features for a richer user experience.
